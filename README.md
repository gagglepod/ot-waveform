# OT Waveform Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to create an audio waveform UI that allows the user to click on the waveform and captures the audio playtime in seconds. Each of these clicks will populate an array of timestamps (in seconds), allow the user to give each timestamp a title, and finally display those titles on the screen as a list of potential chapter markers (ordered by seconds ascending).

## UI Requirements

- Clickable Audio Waveform UI
- Captured of audio playtime seconds
- Store playtime seconds in an array of timestamps (ordered by seconds ascending)
- Form to add Titles to each recorded timestamp
- Cancel button to remove Titles and Timestamps
- Save button to store final chapters in a Firestore database
